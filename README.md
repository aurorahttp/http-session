HTTP Session
============

HTTP Session is NOT web session, but HTTP transaction container.

Usual, a HTTP session has a (socet) connection, but this is indeterminate. 
The connection is actual, the session is abstract. Session is HTTP transaction
container, it manages one or multiple HTTP transaction.
